    "## <span style='color:yellow'>Once the environment is crafted, activate it with <span style='color:blue; font-family: monospace;'>conda activate NAME</span>. Subsequently, copy and paste the command provided on the PyTorch website (referenced in the preceding figure) and press Enter. For instance: <span style='color:blue; font-family: monospace;'>conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia</span>.</span>\n",

    "## <span style='color:yellow'>The concluding step involves linking conda with your IDE. For instance, if you're using PyCharm, modify the Python interpreter path to the newly installed conda environment. Alternatively, for users of VSCode, press Ctrl+Shift+P.</span>\n",
